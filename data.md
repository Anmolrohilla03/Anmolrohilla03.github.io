Unnatti is a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering underprivileged children through education, mentorship, and holistic development programs. Their mission is to break the cycle of poverty by providing children from underserved communities with the resources and support the old age home to live and cherish every moment
I collaborated with a non-profit organization dedicated to educating underprivileged children and supporting senior citizens. The goal was to increase their brand awareness and boost community involvement through the design of business cards, visiting cards, and brochures. These materials helped raise the organization’s profile and attracted more volunteers and donations, positively impacting the lives of both the children and seniors they serve.
